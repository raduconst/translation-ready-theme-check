Translation Tester is a plugin made to help you check the POT file

== Description ==

Checking the POT file of your theme or plugin can be a real pain sometimes. If you want to make sure that all the strings are included in the POT file, you need to create the PO/MO files from it and translate each string, one by one.

This plugin is made to do a simple thing: get all the strings from your POT file and the translated part will be a concatenation between the original string and a prefix at your choice.

The options from Tools -> Translation check help you with uploading and choosing a prefix. Once you press Test button, a PO file will be downloaded to your computer. Just generate the MO file from it, copy both of them in your website and see how it goes.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =

* Set the uploading and prefix options. You can work with one POT file at a time.

== Installation ==

Install Translation Tester either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to manually upload the POT file of my theme or plugin? =
For the moment, the plugin is made to work only this way by giving him the file manually.
The next update will give you the option to select the POT files that you would like to check from the themes and plugins that you have installed on your website.
